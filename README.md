<h4>about me:</h4> <br>
I am just a normal guy who just loves computers and opensource stuff and want to build a different society. Why? because this society sucks.<br>
I am not giving you a lecture about how it sucks, you all know about it already and if you couldn't guess it, just gtfo of my profile.<br>
do you remember when the web is not bloat enough no one is tracking you, piracy was cool, there were cool things on 4chan and reddit.<br>
when we got friends. that vintage evening in the park. but sadly we can't go in past.<br>
we just have to make a cool and different society where everyone is free we don't get judge by our marks and different things.<br>
idk why I just can't express all of my ideas here................
<br>
<br>

why am I writing this here because I don't have friends to tell my ideas or otherthings. so I posted it hereyou can mail me your ideas about this opensource society.
